# NextionSerialString

## Description
A simple Nextion HMI library which computes string commands. The library is both a simple and powerful tool, easily modified to meet oneâ€™s needs. Designed and tested on the esp32 - however it is assumed to be compatible with other MCUs.

Feel free to support my work! If you found this code useful and it saved you some time and effort, send a small sum of appreciation (to the value you think it is worth)

## Installation

### First Method **(Coming Soon)**
1.  In the Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries
2.  In the Library Manager you will find a list of libraries that are already installed, or ready for installation.
3.  Search for NextionSerialString using the search bar.
4.  Click on the text area and select the latest version to install.

### Second Method
1. Download the latest release of the NextionSerialString library from: [https://github.com/darrenjcosborne/NextionSerialString](https://github.com/darrenjcosborne/NextionSerialString)
2. Extract the `.zip` file 
3. Copy the NextionSerialString folder, to: ....\Arduino\libraries\

***NOTE***: The `.HMI` and `.TFT` files for the Nextion Editor/Display are also included in the example folder.
The `.HMI` file was designed for the Nextion NX4024T032_011 3.2" Basic Display.

## A Simple Setup

### NextionConfig.h

1. Define each of the parameters according to your preferred settings
````Cpp
#define NEXSERIAL Serial2     // Define serial communication channel
#define BAUD 115200     // Define baud rate. esp32 uses a baud rate of 115200
#define RX 16     // Define receiving data pin (RX)
#define TX 17     // Define transmission data pin (TX)
````
### NextionSerialString.ino

1.  **Include** ***NextionSerialString*** and create an object of `NextionSerialString` class
````Cpp
#include "NextionSerialString.h"      // Include NextionSerialString Library
#include "NextionConfig.h"      // Include NextionConfig
````
2.  **Begin the object** using parameters from `NextionConfig.h`
````Cpp
NextionSerialString myNextion(NEXSERIAL, BAUD, RX, TX);    // Initialise connection object                  
````
3.  **Place** the **begin()** function in the setup
````Cpp
void setup(){
  myNextion.begin();     // This function must be called to reset the baud rate on the Nextion, to match that of the esp32
}
````
4. **Place** the **listen()** function in the loop
````Cpp
void loop(){
  myNextion.listen();      // This function must be called repeatedly to respond to touch events from the Nextion panel
}
````

### GUIFunctions.cpp

1. **Create any custom function** from this point on to read the incoming serial data
````Cpp
_serial->println(_serialData);      // Prints the string data received from the Nextion

/*!
  * Put your code here and create any custom function to read the incoming serial data
  * Utilise the string.h library for optimal efficiency
  */
````
### Please note
When compiling and uploading, ***ensure the transmission (TX) cable*** from the Nextion Display is ***NOT connected*** to the receiving (RX) pin of the esp32, otherwise it will timeout.

Enjoy the NextionSerialString Library! :)
